# A Neural Network Library From Scratch
A neural network library I wrote as a component of my undergraduate thesis. The only external library I use to create the neural network is NumPy. I based my library off of Michael Nielsen's [network2.py](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/tree/master/src) neural network library.

## The library 
### network_library.py
Where the code for the neural network library is held.

## Tests
### train_network.py
Train a 
### architecture_test.py
### L2_regularization_test.py
### small_weight_initialization_test.py

### cost_function_test.py

### dropconnect_test.py

### dropout_test.py

## Miscelaneous
### mnist_loader.py
Loads the mnist.pkl.gz file as data 

### mnist.pkl.gz

### network.txt
